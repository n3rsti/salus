# Salus - mental health and mindfulness platform


# Project Description

This project is the result of teamwork as part of the project assignment for the [Software Engineering](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/proinz) course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

## Project Overview

Salus is a digital platform designed to support mental wellness through guided meditations, daily mindfulness challenges, and tools for mood and habit tracking. The app helps users monitor aspects like sleep quality, focus, and stress levels, and provides personalized recommendations to improve overall well-being based on their individual goals and tracked data.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project comes from the increasing need for accessible and data-driven mental health support. Many people struggle to maintain mindfulness habits or track their emotional health consistently. Salus aims to make self-care simple, engaging, and help users build healthier routines.

## Problem We’re Solving

Existing mental health apps often focus on either guided content or tracking, but rarely integrate both with personalization. Our goal is to combine guided mindfulness practices with smart habit analytics and share it with people for free!

## What We’re Learning

Throughout this project, we’re learning to:

- Work effectively as a team—collaborating on design and development.

- Manage a complete project lifecycle—from planning and task distribution to implementation and testing.

- Explore new technologies and frameworks, such as:

  - Frontend: Nuxt / Vue.js

  - Backend: Django / Python

  - Data & AI: Recommendation algorithms for personalization

## Functional Requirements

Highlight key features and functionalities.

# 📝 Code of Conduct [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
As students, you are surely familiar with the minimum acceptable behavior defined in the **STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT** of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, as well as additional guidelines for teamwork in the Software Engineering course.

We expect you to follow the **[IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html)**, which plays an important educational role in setting the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. By doing so, the professional community of software engineers defines general principles that establish moral character, guide important business decisions, and set clear moral expectations for all members of the community.

The Code of Conduct is a set of enforceable rules that serve to clearly communicate expectations and requirements for the community/team's work. It defines obligations, rights, unacceptable behaviors, and appropriate consequences (unlike the ethical code). In this repository, one of the widely accepted codes of conduct for working in open-source communities is provided.

> ### Improve Team Functionality:
> - Define how work will be distributed among team members.
> - Agree on how the team will communicate.
> - Don’t waste time on deciding how the group will resolve disputes—apply the standards!
> - It is implicitly assumed that all team members will follow the code of conduct.
> 
> ## Issue Reporting
> 
> The worst thing that can happen is for someone to remain silent when there are problems. There are several things you can do to best resolve conflicts and issues:
> 
> - Contact me directly via [e-mail](mailto:vlado.sruk@fer.hr), and we will do everything we can to confidentially understand what steps we need to take to resolve the problem.
> - Talk to your assistant, as they have the best insight into the team dynamics. Together, you’ll figure out how to resolve the conflict and how to avoid further impact on your work.
> - If you feel comfortable, discuss the problem directly. Minor incidents should be resolved directly. Take time and privately speak with the affected team member and trust in their sincerity.
